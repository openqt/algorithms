https://projecteuler.net/problem=237

Let T( _n_ ) be the number of tours over a 4 × _n_ playing board such that:

  * The tour starts in the top left corner.
  * The tour consists of moves that are up, down, left, or right one square.
  * The tour visits each square exactly once.
  * The tour ends in the bottom left corner.

The diagram shows one tour over a 4 × 10 board:

T(10) is 2329. What is T(1012) modulo 108?
