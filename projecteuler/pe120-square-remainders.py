"""120. Square remainders
https://projecteuler.net/problem=120

Let _r_ be the remainder when ( _a_ −1) _n_ \+ ( _a_ +1) _n_ is divided by _a_
2.

For example, if _a_ = 7 and _n_ = 3, then _r_ = 42: 6 3 \+ 83 = 728 ≡ 42 mod
49. And as _n_ varies, so too will _r_ , but for _a_ = 7 it turns out that _r_
max = 42.

For 3 ≤ _a_ ≤ 1000, find  ∑ _r_ max.
