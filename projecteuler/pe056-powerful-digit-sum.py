"""56. Powerful digit sum
https://projecteuler.net/problem=56

A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, _a b_, where _a, b_ < 100, what is
the maximum digital sum?
