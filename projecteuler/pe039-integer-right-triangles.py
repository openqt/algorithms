"""39. Integer right triangles
https://projecteuler.net/problem=39

If _p_ is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{ _a_ , _b_ , _c_ }, there are exactly three solutions for _p_ = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of _p_ â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
