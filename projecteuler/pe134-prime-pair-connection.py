"""134. Prime pair connection
https://projecteuler.net/problem=134

Consider the consecutive primes _p_ 1 = 19 and _p_ 2 = 23. It can be verified
that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by _p_ 1
whilst also being divisible by _p_ 2.

In fact, with the exception of _p_ 1 = 3 and _p_ 2 = 5, for every pair of
consecutive primes, _p_ 2 > _p_ 1, there exist values of _n_ for which the
last digits are formed by _p_ 1 and _n_ is divisible by _p_ 2. Let _S_ be the
smallest of these values of _n_.

Find ∑ _S_ for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ _p_ 1 ≤ 1000000.
