"""119. Digit power sum
https://projecteuler.net/problem=119

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 83 = 512. Another example of a number
with this property is 614656 = 284.

We shall define _a_ n to be the _n_ th term of this sequence and insist that a
number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that _a_ 2 = 512 and _a_ 10 = 614656.

Find _a_ 30.
