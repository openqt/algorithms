"""145. How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?
https://projecteuler.net/problem=145

Some positive integers _n_ have the property that the sum [ _n_ \+ reverse(
_n_ ) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99
and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers _reversible_ ; so 36, 63, 409,
and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either _n_ or
reverse( _n_ ).

There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
