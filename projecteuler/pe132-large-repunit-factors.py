"""132. Large repunit factors
https://projecteuler.net/problem=132

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(
_k_ ) to be a repunit of length _k_.

For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11×41×271×9091, and the sum of these prime
factors is 9414.

Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(109).
