"""135. Same differences
https://projecteuler.net/problem=135

Given the positive integers, _x_ , _y_ , and _z_ , are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, _n_ , for
which the equation, _x_ 2 − _y_ 2 − _z_ 2 = _n_ , has exactly two solutions is
_n_ = 27:

342 − 272 − 202 = 122 − 92 − 62 = 27

It turns out that _n_ = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten
solutions.

How many values of _n_ less than one million have exactly ten distinct
solutions?
