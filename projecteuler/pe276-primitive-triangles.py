"""276. Primitive Triangles
https://projecteuler.net/problem=276

Consider the triangles with integer sides a, b and c with a ≤ b ≤ c.  
An integer sided triangle (a,b,c) is called primitive if  gcd(a,b,c)=1.  
How many primitive integer sided triangles exist with a perimeter not
exceeding 10 000 000?
