"""129. Repunit divisibility
https://projecteuler.net/problem=129

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(
_k_ ) to be a repunit of length _k_ ; for example, R(6) = 111111.

Given that _n_ is a positive integer and GCD( _n_ , 10) = 1, it can be shown
that there always exists a value, _k_ , for which R( _k_ ) is divisible by _n_
, and let A( _n_ ) be the least such value of _k_ ; for example, A(7) = 6 and
A(41) = 5.

The least value of _n_ for which A( _n_ ) first exceeds ten is 17.

Find the least value of _n_ for which A( _n_ ) first exceeds one-million.
