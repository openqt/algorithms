"""131. Prime cube partnership
https://projecteuler.net/problem=131

There are some prime values, _p_ , for which there exists a positive integer,
_n_ , such that the expression _n_ 3 \+ _n_ 2 _p_ is a perfect cube.

For example, when _p_ = 19, 8 3 \+ 82Ã—19 = 123.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the
value of _n_ is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
