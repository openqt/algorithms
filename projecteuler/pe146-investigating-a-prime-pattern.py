"""146. Investigating a Prime Pattern
https://projecteuler.net/problem=146

The smallest positive integer _n_ for which the numbers _n_ 2+1, _n_ 2+3, _n_
2+7, _n_ 2+9, _n_ 2+13, and _n_ 2+27 are consecutive primes is 10. The sum of
all such integers _n_ below one-million is 1242490.

What is the sum of all such integers _n_ below 150 million?
