"""123. Prime square remainders
https://projecteuler.net/problem=123

Let _p_ n be the _n_ th prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let _r_ be the
remainder when ( _p_ n−1) _n_ \+ ( _p_ n+1) _n_ is divided by _p_ n2.

For example, when _n_ = 3, _p_ 3 = 5, and 43 \+ 63 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

The least value of _n_ for which the remainder first exceeds 10 9 is 7037.

Find the least value of _n_ for which the remainder first exceeds 10 10.
