"""141. Investigating progressive numbers, <i>n</i>, which are also square
https://projecteuler.net/problem=141

A positive integer, _n_ , is divided by _d_ and the quotient and remainder are
_q_ and _r_ respectively. In addition _d_ , _q_ , and _r_ are consecutive
positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that
order.

For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can also be
seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio
3/2).  
We will call such numbers, _n_ , progressive.

Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 1022, happen to also be
perfect squares.  
The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is
124657.

Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion (1012).
