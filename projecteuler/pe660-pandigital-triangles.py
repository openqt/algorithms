"""660. Pandigital Triangles
https://projecteuler.net/problem=660

We call an integer sided triangle _$n$-pandigital_ if it contains one angle of
120 degrees and, when the sides of the triangle are written in base $n$,
together they use all $n$ digits of that base exactly once.

For example, the triangle (217, 248, 403) is 9-pandigital because it contains
one angle of 120 degrees and the sides written in base 9 are $261_9, 305_9,
487_9$ using each of the 9 digits of that base once.

Find the sum of the largest sides of all n-pandigital triangles with $9 \le n
\le 18$.
