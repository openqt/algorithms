"""136. Singleton difference
https://projecteuler.net/problem=136

The positive integers, _x_ , _y_ , and _z_ , are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression. Given that _n_ is a positive integer, the equation,
_x_ 2 − _y_ 2 − _z_ 2 = _n_ , has exactly one solution when _n_ = 20:

132 − 102 − 72 = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of _n_ below one hundred for which the
equation has a unique solution.

How many values of _n_ less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
