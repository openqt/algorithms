"""104. Pandigital Fibonacci ends
https://projecteuler.net/problem=104

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> F _n_ = F _n_ −1 \+ F _n_ −2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci
number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the
digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575
digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9
pandigital.

Given that F _k_ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits
AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find _k_.
