/*376. Wiggle Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/description/

<p>A sequence of numbers is called a <strong>wiggle sequence</strong> if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence. </p>

<p>For example, <code>[1,7,4,9,2,5]</code> is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, <code>[1,4,7,2,5]</code> and <code>[1,7,4,5,5]</code> are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.</p>

<p>Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.</p>

<p><b>Examples:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,7,4,9,2,5]
<b>Output:</b> 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

<b>Input:</b> [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
<b>Output:</b> 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
<b>Output:</b> 2
