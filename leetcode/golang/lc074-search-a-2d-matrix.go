/*74. Search a 2D Matrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description/

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an _m_ x _n_ matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:

  * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
  * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    matrix = [
      [1,   3,  5,  7],
      [10, 11, 16, 20],
      [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    target = 3
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    matrix = [
      [1,   3,  5,  7],
      [10, 11, 16, 20],
      [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    target = 13
    **Output:** false
