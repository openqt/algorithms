/*1. Two Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that
they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you
may not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**

    
    
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    
    Because nums[ **0** ] + nums[ **1** ] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [ **0** , **1** ].
