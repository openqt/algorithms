/*16. 3Sum Closest
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/description/

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, find three
integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of
the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one
solution.

**Example:**

    
    
    Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
    
    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
