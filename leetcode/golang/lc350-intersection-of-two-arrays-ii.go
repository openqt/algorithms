/*350. Intersection of Two Arrays II
https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/description/

<p>
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b><br />
Given <i>nums1</i> = <code>[1, 2, 2, 1]</code>, <i>nums2</i> = <code>[2, 2]</code>, return <code>[2, 2]</code>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.</li>
<li>The result can be in any order.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Follow up:</b><br />
<ul>
<li>What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?</li>
<li>What if <i>nums1</i>'s size is small compared to <i>nums2</i>'s size? Which algorithm is better?</li>
<li>What if elements of <i>nums2</i> are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?</li>
</ul>
</p>
