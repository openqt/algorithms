/*238. Product of Array Except Self
https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers where _n_ > 1,  return an array `output`
such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums`
except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:**  [1,2,3,4]
    **Output:** [24,12,8,6]
    

**Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O( _n_ ).

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does
not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
