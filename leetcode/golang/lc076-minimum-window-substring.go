/*76. Minimum Window Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will
contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input: S** =  "ADOBECODEBANC", **T** =  "ABC"
    **Output:**  "BANC"
    

**Note:**

  * If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.
  * If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
