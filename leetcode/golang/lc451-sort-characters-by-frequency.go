/*451. Sort Characters By Frequency
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/description/

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of
characters.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    "tree"
    
    **Output:**
    "eert"
    
    **Explanation:**
    'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
    So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    "cccaaa"
    
    **Output:**
    "cccaaa"
    
    **Explanation:**
    Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
    Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    "Aabb"
    
    **Output:**
    "bbAa"
    
    **Explanation:**
    "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
    Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
