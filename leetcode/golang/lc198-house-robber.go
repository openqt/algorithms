/*198. House Robber
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you
from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system
connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent
houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each
house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without
alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,2,3,1]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
                  Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [2,7,9,3,1]
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
                  Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
