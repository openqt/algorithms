/*42. Trapping Rain Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/

Given _n_ non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![](http://www.leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/rainwatertrap.png)  
The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In
this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. **Thanks
