/*398. Random Pick Index
https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-index/description/

<p>
Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b><br />
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<pre>
int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
</pre>
</p>
