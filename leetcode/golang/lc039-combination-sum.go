/*39. Combination Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/

Given a **set** of candidate numbers (`candidates`) **(without duplicates)**
and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates`
where the candidate numbers sums to `target`.

The **same** repeated number may be chosen from `candidates` unlimited number
of times.

**Note:**

  * All numbers (including `target`) will be positive integers.
  * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
    **A solution set is:**
    [
      [7],
      [2,2,3]
    ]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
    **A solution set is:**
    [
       [2,2,2,2],
      [2,3,3],
      [3,5]
    ]
