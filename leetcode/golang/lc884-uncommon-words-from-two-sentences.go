/*884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/description/

We are given two sentences `A` and `B`.  (A _sentence_  is a string of space
separated words.  Each _word_ consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is _uncommon_  if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and
does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words.

You may return the list in any order.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
    **Output:** ["sweet","sour"]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
    **Output:** ["banana"]
    



**Note:**

  1. `0 <= A.length <= 200`
  2. `0 <= B.length <= 200`
  3. `A` and `B` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
