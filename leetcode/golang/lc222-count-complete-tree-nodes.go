/*222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/description/

Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.

**Note:**

**_Definition of a complete binary tree
from[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):_**  
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely
filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can
have between 1 and 2 h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** 
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /
    4  5 6
    
    **Output:** 6
