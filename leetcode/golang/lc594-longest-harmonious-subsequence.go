/*594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/description/

We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its
maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest
harmonious subsequence among all its possible
[subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence).

**Example 1:**  

    
    
    **Input:** [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
    

**Note:** The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
