/*363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K
https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/description/

Given a non-empty 2D matrix _matrix_ and an integer _k_ , find the max sum of
a rectangle in the _matrix_ such that its sum is no larger than _k_.

**Example:**  

    
    
    Given matrix = [
      [1,  0, 1],
      [0, -2, 3]
    ]
    k = 2
    

The answer is `2`. Because the sum of rectangle `[[0, 1], [-2, 3]]` is 2 and 2
is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).

**Note:**  

  1. The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
  2. What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
