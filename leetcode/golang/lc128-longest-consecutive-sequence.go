/*128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O( _n_ ) complexity.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:**  [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
