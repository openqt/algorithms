https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of
islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent
lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid
are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    11110
    11010
    11000
    00000
    
    **Output:**  1
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    11000
    11000
    00100
    00011
    
    **Output:** 3
