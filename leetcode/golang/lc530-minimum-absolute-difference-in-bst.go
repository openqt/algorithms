/*530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/description/

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum
[absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference)
between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    
       1
        \
         3
        /
       2
    
    **Output:**
    1
    
    **Explanation:**
    The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
    

**Note:** There are at least two nodes in this BST.
