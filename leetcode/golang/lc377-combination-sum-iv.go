/*377. Combination Sum IV
https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/description/

Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the
number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

**Example:**

    
    
    _**nums**_ = [1, 2, 3]
    _**target**_ = 4
    
    The possible combination ways are:
    (1, 1, 1, 1)
    (1, 1, 2)
    (1, 2, 1)
    (1, 3)
    (2, 1, 1)
    (2, 2)
    (3, 1)
    
    Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
    
    Therefore the output is _**7_**.
    

**Follow up:**  
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?  
How does it change the problem?  
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
