/*3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating
characters.

**Examples:**

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the
answer must be a **substring** , `"pwke"` is a _subsequence_ and not a
substring.
