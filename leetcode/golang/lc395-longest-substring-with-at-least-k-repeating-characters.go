/*395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/description/

Find the length of the longest substring **_T_** of a given string (consists
of lowercase letters only) such that every character in **_T_** appears no
less than _k_ times.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input:
    s = "aaabb", k = 3
    
    Output:
    3
    
    The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input:
    s = "ababbc", k = 2
    
    Output:
    5
    
    The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
