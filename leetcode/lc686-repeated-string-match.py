"""Repeated String Match
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/

<p>Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.</p>

<p>
For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab". </p>

<p>
Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
The length of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> will be between 1 and 10000.
