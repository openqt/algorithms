"""124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/

Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some
starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The
path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the
root.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,2,3]
    
           **1**
          **/ \**
         **2**   **3**
    
    **Output:** 6
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    
        -10
       / \
      9   **20**
         **/  \**
        **15   7**
    
    **Output:** 42
