"""258. Add Digits
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/

Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the
result has only one digit.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** 38
    **Output:** 2 
    **Explanation:** The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
                 Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
    

**Follow up:**  
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
