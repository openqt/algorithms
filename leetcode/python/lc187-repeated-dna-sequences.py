"""187. Repeated DNA Sequences
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/description/

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T,
for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to
identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** s =  "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
    
    **Output:** [ "AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
