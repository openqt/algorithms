"""407. Trapping Rain Water II
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/description/

<p>Given an <code>m x n</code> matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
Both <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<pre>
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

Return 4.
</pre>
</p>

The above image represents the elevation map <code>[[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]</code> before the rain.
</p>

<p>

After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.
