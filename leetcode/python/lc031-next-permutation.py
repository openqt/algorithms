"""31. Next Permutation
https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/description/

Implement **next permutation** , which rearranges numbers into the
lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest
possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be **[in-place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-
place_algorithm)** and use only constant  extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its
corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

`1,2,3` -> `1,3,2`  
`3,2,1` -> `1,2,3`  
`1,1,5` -> `1,5,1`
