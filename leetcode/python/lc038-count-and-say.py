"""38. Count and Say
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description/

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five
terms as following:

    
    
    1.     1
    2.     11
    3.     21
    4.     1211
    5.     111221
    

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.  
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.  
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.  

Given an integer _n_ , generate the _n_ th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** 1
    **Output:** "1"
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 4
    **Output:** "1211"
