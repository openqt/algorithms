"""136. Single Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/

Given a **non-empty**  array of integers, every element appears _twice_ except
for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it
without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [2,2,1]
    **Output:** 1
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [4,1,2,1,2]
    **Output:** 4
