"""300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing
subsequence.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    **Output:** 4 
    **Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

**Note:**

  * There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
  * Your algorithm should run in O( _n 2_) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O( _n_ log _n_ ) time complexity?
