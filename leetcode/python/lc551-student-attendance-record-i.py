"""551. Student Attendance Record I
https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/description/

You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The
record only contains the following three characters:

  1. **'A'** : Absent. 
  2. **'L'** : Late.
  3. **'P'** : Present. 

A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain **more
than one 'A' (absent)** or **more than two continuous 'L' (late)**.

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his
attendance record.

**Example 1:**

    **Output:** True
    

**Example 2:**
