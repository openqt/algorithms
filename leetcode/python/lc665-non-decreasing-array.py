"""665. Non-decreasing Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/description/

Given an array with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become
non-decreasing by modifying **at most** `1` element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if `array[i] <= array[i + 1]` holds for
every `i` (1 <= i < n).

**Example 1:**  

    
    
    **Input:** [4,2,3]
    **Output:** True
    **Explanation:** You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
    

**Example 2:**  

    
    
    **Input:** [4,2,1]
    **Output:** False
    **Explanation:** You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
    

**Note:** The `n` belongs to [1, 10,000].
