"""212. Word Search II
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/description/

Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in
the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The
same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** 
    **words** = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and **board** =
    [
      ['o','a','a','n'],
      ['e','t','a','e'],
      ['i','h','k','r'],
      ['i','f','l','v']
    ]
    
    **Output:  **["eat","oath"]
    

**Note:**  
You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.
