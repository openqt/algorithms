"""191. Number of 1 Bits
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1'
bits it has (also known as the [Hamming
weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** 11
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Integer 11 has binary representation **00000000000000000000000000001011**
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 128
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** Integer 128 has binary representation **00000000000000000000000010000000**
