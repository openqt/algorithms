"""213. House Robber II
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/description/

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
**arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the
last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and   **it
will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into
on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each
house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without
alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [2,3,2]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
                  because they are adjacent houses.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,2,3,1]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
                  Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
