"""53. Maximum Subarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at
least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:**  [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
    

**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the O( _n_ ) solution, try coding another solution
using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
