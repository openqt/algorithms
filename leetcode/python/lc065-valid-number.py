Validate if a given string is numeric.

Some examples:  
`"0"` => `true`  
`" 0.1 "` => `true`  
`"abc"` => `false`  
`"1 a"` => `false`  
`"2e10"` => `true`

**Note:** It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should
gather all requirements up front before implementing one.

**Update (2015-02-10):**  
The signature of the `C++` function had been updated. If you still see your
function signature accepts a `const char *` argument, please click the reload
