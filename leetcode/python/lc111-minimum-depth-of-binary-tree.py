"""111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root
node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:**  A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

    
    
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7

return its minimum depth = 2.
