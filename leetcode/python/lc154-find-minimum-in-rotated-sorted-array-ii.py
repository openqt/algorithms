"""154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to
you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,3,5]
    **Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [2,2,2,0,1]
    **Output:** 0

**Note:**

  * This is a follow up problem to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
  * Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
