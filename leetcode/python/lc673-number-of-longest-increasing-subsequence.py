"""673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/description/

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing
subsequence.

**Example 1:**  

    
    
    **Input:** [1,3,5,4,7]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
    

**Example 2:**  

    
    
    **Input:** [2,2,2,2,2]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
    

**Note:** Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is
guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
