"""88. Merge Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/

Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_ , merge _nums2_ into
_nums1_ as one sorted array.

**Note:**

  * The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
  * You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is greater or equal to _m_ \+ _n_ ) to hold additional elements from _nums2_.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
    nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
    
    **Output:**  [1,2,2,3,5,6]
