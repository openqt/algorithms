"""275. H-Index II
https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/description/

Given an array of citations **sorted  in ascending order **(each citation is a
non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the
researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index  _h_
if  _h_  of his/her  _N_  papers have  **at least**   _h_  citations each, and
the other  _N âˆ’ h_ papers have  **no more than**   _h  _citations each."

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
    **Output:** 3 
    **Explanation:**[0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
                 received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
                 Since the researcher has 3 papers with **at least** 3 citations each and the remaining 
                 two with **no more than** 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for  _h_ , the maximum one is taken as
the h-index.

**Follow up:**

  * This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
  * Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
