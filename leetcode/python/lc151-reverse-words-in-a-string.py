"""151. Reverse Words in a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example:   **

    
    
    **Input:**  "the sky is blue",
    **Output:  **"blue is sky the".
    

**Note:**

  * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
  * Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
  * You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Follow up:  **For C programmers, try to solve it _in-place_ in _O_ (1)
space.
