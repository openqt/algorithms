"""543. Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/

<p>
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the <b>longest</b> path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b><br />
Given a binary tree <br />
<pre>
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Return <b>3</b>, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
