"""516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/description/

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You
may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**  
Input:

    
    
    "bbbab"
    

Output:

    
    
    4
    

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**  
Input:

    
    
    "cbbd"
    

Output:

    
    
    2
    

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
