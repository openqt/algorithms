"""62. Unique Paths
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid (marked  'Start'
in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the
diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** m = 3, n = 2
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:**
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right - > Right -> Down
    2. Right -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Right
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** m = 7, n = 3
    **Output:** 28
