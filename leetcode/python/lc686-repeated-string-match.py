"""686. Repeated String Match
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be
repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a
substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times
("abcdabcd").

**Note:**  
The length of `A` and `B` will be between 1 and 10000.
