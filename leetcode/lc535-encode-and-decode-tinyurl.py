"""Encode and Decode TinyURL
https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/description/

<blockquote>Note: This is a companion problem to the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/system-design/">System Design</a> problem: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl/">Design TinyURL</a>.</blockquote>

<p>TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as <code>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl</code> and it returns a short URL such as <code>http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk</code>.</p>

<p>Design the <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.</p>
